    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p><strong style="color:white;background-color:#ad1625"> ! </strong> It is necessary to distinguish between file and folder in some cases. The user then needs to use path separator after the folder name. For example on Linux: When you copy /foo/doc.txt to /bar/dest it will produce file /bar/dest, otherwise when you copy to /bar/dest<strong style="color:#ad1625">/</strong> it will produce file /bar/dest/doc.txt.</p>
    <p>If the source is a <strong>folder</strong> and the destination is a <strong>folder</strong>, the source folder with the whole subtree will be copied/moved/linked to the destination folder with the original names.</p>
    <p>If the source is a <strong>file</strong> and the destination is a <strong>folder</strong>, the source file will be copied/moved/linked to the destination folder with the original name.</p>
    <p>If the source is a <strong>file</strong> and the destination is a <strong>file</strong>, the source file will be copied/moved/linked with the new name.</p>
    <p>If the source is a <strong>globbing expression</strong> (name with wildcards) and the destination is a <strong>folder</strong>, the matched files from source folder will be copied/moved/linked to the destination folder with the original names.</p>
    <p>Other combinations of source/destination are not applicable.</p>
    <p>Missing folders will be created, e.g. when a file is copied to the unexisting folder.</p>
    <p>If <em>Overwrite</em> is not checked and the target already exists, it will cause an error. It is possible to use <em>catch</em> node for it.</p>
    <p>Created links are always symbolic.</p>
    <p>If <em>Src Fname</em> (<em>Dst Fname</em>) is absolute, only that is used. If it is relative, it is combined with <em>Src Path</em> (<em>Dst Path</em>). If the path is not presented (or it is also relative), the current working folder is used.</p>
